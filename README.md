# 🏙️ AI-Governed Smart City 2070

An experimental hackathon project simulating how an **AI-powered mayor** governs a futuristic smart city in the year **2070**. Citizens can interact with the mayor to resolve issues, allocate resources, and experience next-gen governance.

## 🚀 Features (MVP)

- 👤 **Citizen Login/Register** (basic auth)
- 📊 **City Dashboard**
  - Energy allocation (renewable, nuclear, backup)
  - Water distribution (reservoir levels)
  - Transport system status (hyperloop, drone taxis)
- 🤖 **AI Mayor**
  - Citizens can chat with an AI-powered mayor  
  - Example:  
    *“Mayor, resolve traffic in Sector-5.”*  
    → AI responds with futuristic decisions
- ⚖️ **Conflict Resolution**
  - Citizens raise issues (e.g., water shortage, traffic jam)  
  - AI suggests fair, futuristic solutions
- 🎨 **Futuristic UI**
  - Dark theme, neon accents, hologram-inspired

### 🤖 Example AI Mayor Interaction

## Citizen Query:
### Mayor, there’s traffic congestion in Sector-5.

## Mayor Response:
# Deploying 20 drone taxis and rerouting Hyperloop from Sector-3 to Sector-5. Congestion reduced.

## 🔮 Future Extensions
## 🌍 3D/AR City Visualization (Three.js / CesiumJS)
## ☀️ Climate Impact Decisions (Mayor builds solar plants, manages pollution)
## 🧠 NeuralLink Input (thought-to-text citizen queries)
## 🪙 Blockchain Resource Credits (citizens trade energy/water credits)

# 🏆 Hackathon Pitch

## This project demonstrates how AI governance can manage futuristic cities in 2070, balancing resources, resolving conflicts, and enhancing citizen experience — powered by LangChain, OpenAI, and a sci-fi dashboard UI.
